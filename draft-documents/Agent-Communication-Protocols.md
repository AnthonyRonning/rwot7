# Agent Communication Protocols

## Abstract

The term agent has been used in many context within the self sovereign identity world. But what exactly we mean by an agent? This paper will try to summarize the agent concept and at the same time identify the main phases and messages they need to exchange in order to be able to connect, receive credentials and share proofs between each other. We will start by assuming the discoverability of those agents. 

## Message Families

* Establish a secure connection
* Attestation: Receiving Credentials
* Verification: Sharing Proofs
* Consent: How are you going to use my data? data retention? policies?
* Error handling: How do we manage errors in the asynchronous interactions
