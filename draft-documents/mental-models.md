## Outline:
- Introductions to models of identity (we think about this different ways)
    - What are the problems that we are trying to solve?
        - The models have interconnectedness that a single model doesn’t address alone -- how do we think about the intersections to reconcile between models.
- Models Introduction:
    - Security or corporal - Is this the right physical entity (especially human based on “strong confidence”
    - Liberty - how do I present myself to others “I am a ______”
    - Data - these XX fields constitute identity information.
    - Relational - Ubuntu, “I am who I am because of who we are”
    - Capabilities - My identity is what I can do, regardless of who says so
- Pitfalls and Specific Guidance:
    - Security/Corporeal security alongside liberty
    - Leakiness of unique identifiers (EMPI systems and challenges of 99% unique person:identifier issues) 
    - Capabilities over time (past capability)
    - Relational identity and reputation
    - Leakiness of the “data” view - “metadata is data too”
    - Contextuality of data for liberty and security
    - Game theory of credentials and ontology over time
        - “Yellow star” systems
        - Checks and balances trump principles for governance over time
- Therefore what? - Conclusions and next steps (come and help call to action)
